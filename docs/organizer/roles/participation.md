# Participation Roles

The participation roles are a set of labels an attendee or a tournament has.


## Management

The participation roles available in a tournament are managed under [Tournament - Rights - Roles](https://cc.iypt.org/tournament/rights/roles/) 

Their properties are 

**Name**
: An arbitrary name

**Type**
: A predefined type (leave empty for most new roles)

**Groups**
: A list of permission groups which everyone with this role automatically gets.

**Approvable by**
: The roles which are able to approve [role applications](https://cc.iypt.org/registration/accept/role/list/) for this participation role. The idea here was to let the LOC accept FA.

**Global Limit**
: This is a global limit or attendees in this role. Leave it empty for most roles. It only has an effect for visitors, as team managers can only accept visitors to their team up to this limit.

**Attending**
: Are attendees with this role physically present at the tournament. E.g. Team Manager or IOC member allone does not qualify to attend the tournament. To be able to come to the tournament on site, they additionaly need a participating role such as Juror or Team Leader.

**Require Possible Juror**
: Does the application to this role (Registration - My Applications - Detailed Process -  Apply with role) require the applicant to be a possible juror?

**Application Deadline**
: Until when is it possible to apply to this role.

**Virtual Room Role**
: What BBB role will someone with this participation role joining a hall have.

**Virtual name tag**
: An additional suffix to the name in BBB rooms. This may e.g. be "Juror"

**Virtual show team**
: if checked, in addition to the "virtual name tag", it will also show all affiliations with teams.


## Manual assignment

The main overview of participation roles is available at [Plan - Persons](https://cc.iypt.org/plan/persons).
Select the checkboxes of attendees you want to change at once, then expand the "Actions" bar on top of the page. Under the "set role" select the role and either "set the roles for slected" or "delete roles from selected".

You get a confirmation page which lets you review the changes. On "perform change", they are applied.



## Relation to Team Roles

Participation roles may be arbitrarely changed but are interconnected with team roles (leader, member, captain). This connection is set up in [Tournament - Rights - Team Roles](https://cc.iypt.org/tournament/rights/team_roles/)
such that e.g. a team "Member" is automatically assigned the participation role "Student".
