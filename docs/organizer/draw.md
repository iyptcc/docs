# Drawing of Lots for Teams

This is a list of steps to follow to assign team to lots and create a schedule.

* delete any non-competing team or set it to non-competing at [Plan - Teams](https://cc.iypt.org/plan/teams).
* generate as many [placeholder teams](https://cc.iypt.org/plan/placeholder/teams) as competing teams
* then you can [load](https://cc.iypt.org/plan/placeholder/plan) the matching schedule. 
* draw the lots either at [Placeholder - Teams]( https://cc.iypt.org/plan/placeholder/teams) saving assignments or in [draw view](https://cc.iypt.org/plan/placeholder/control) where you can open a popup with the preliminary plan, then display a team and enter the drawn number with set. (The tabbing sequence matches well for keyboard only operation)
* once every placeholder has a team assigned, [apply the team mapping](https://cc.iypt.org/plan/placeholder/plan)
* then the plan is fully loaded at [Plan - Plan](https://cc.iypt.org/plan/)
* optionally publish the plan at [Fight - Manage - Publish](https://cc.iypt.org/fight/publish/) for each round and set the permissions required to access it.
